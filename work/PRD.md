## Problem Statement
Local florist lacks an online presence to showcase products and receive orders professionally. Currently has no clear way to present floral arrangements or manage customer orders.

## Target User / Operator
End users: Local flower arrangement customers who want to browse and order online.
Operator: Florist business owner who needs to manage product catalog and receive orders effectively.

## Core Functionality
- Display catalog of floral arrangements with images and descriptions
- Show pricing for each arrangement
- WhatsApp order button that prefills with order details
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Contact information and location
- Order customization notes field

## Non-Goals
- Payment processing integration
- Inventory management system
- Delivery tracking
- User accounts / authentication
- Email marketing or CRM platform

## Constraints
- Must work on mobile devices (primary access point)
- Simple to maintain and update by non-technical owner
- No complex backend required (static site preferred)
- Cost-effective solution
