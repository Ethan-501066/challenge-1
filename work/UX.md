# UX

## Desired Feeling
Fresh, warm, professional, welcoming. Customer feels confident they're ordering from a real, trustworthy florist. Mobile experience should feel natural, frictionless, and enjoyable.

## Primary User Flow
1. Land on homepage with hero image of featured arrangement
2. Browse catalog showing arrangement images, names, descriptions, and prices
3. Click arrangement  see full details and available customization options
4. Click \"Order via WhatsApp\"  message template prefilled with arrangement details
5. Send message to florist  florist responds with checkout

## Failure States
What happens when things go wrong?
- Image fails to load: Show placeholder with arrangement name clearly visible
- WhatsApp link breaks: Display manual WhatsApp number prominently
- Mobile viewport too small: Stack content vertically, ensure all buttons are tap-friendly (min 44x44px)
- Connection slow: Optimize image sizes and lazy-load images

## Accessibility / Cognitive Load
Minimize friction:
- No forms or multiple steps required
- Direct WhatsApp link (familiar, trusted platform)
- High-quality, clear images of arrangements
- Simple, consistent color scheme (not overwhelming)
- Minimal text blocks, clear headings
- One primary CTA per section
